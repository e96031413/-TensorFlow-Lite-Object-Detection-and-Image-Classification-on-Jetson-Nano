# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection and Image Classification on Jetson Nano

Live Object Detection and Image Classification System (PiCamera+OpenCV+TensorFlow Lite+Firebase) on Jetson Nano

A Python script that:

[1] Load Pre-trained (Object Detection) and Self-trained (Image Classification)TFLite Model with Argument.

[2] Read image from PiCamera with OpenCV to do Real-Time Object Detection.

[3] If detect specific object ("bird" in the code), save the image.

[4] Use Self-trained Model to do Image Classification on the image with OpenCV.

[5] Upload the Image and classification result (LabelName, ScoreValue, Time, Pubic-Access Image Url) to Firebase Database

[6] Save the above result (LabelName, ScoreValue, Time, Pubic-Access Image Url) as a csv file with append mode.

[7] Once the image and data have been uploaded to Firebase, delete the local images to prevent running out of disk space.


## Usage

```
python3 object_detection_and_image_classification.py
```
